# Barcode Counting Program for Scoring
Connect all barcode readers to the computer prior to starting the program. In order to be detected by the program, barcode readers should be set to “USB-COM” or “USB-Serial.” Once the application starts, it will display a list of barcode readers it has detected. The application can support as many barcode readers as you have USB ports.

The application is completely controlled by barcodes. There are barcode sheets that can be printed to save data, quit, etc. Data is saved in the format required for the Scoring Program Excel spreadsheet.
